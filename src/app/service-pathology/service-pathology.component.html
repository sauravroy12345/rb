                      <p>The concept of personalized medicine in oncology has led to the development of different diagnostic tests to detect genomic alterations which can be targeted by therapeutic molecules. Apart from the molecular approaches, Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is an important aid to reach a definite diagnosis negating the subjective variations and make way to start personalized therapeutic approach. IHC refers to the process of detecting specific antigens in tissue section or smears. Its principle is based on the affinity of an antibody towards its specific antigen.
                        R B with its wide range of Immunohistochemistry (IHC) markers can be the comprehensive and end to end solution to categorize undifferentiated malignant tumors and assess a tumor therapy response.</p>

                        Chromosomal aberrations which cause many developmental defects in adults and children can be detected by cytogenetics tests. It is also possible to predict a miscarriage using cytogenetic studies of the parentsâ€™ chromosomes.</p>

                      <p>The World Health Organisation (WHO) recognizes immunophenotyping as one of the basic tenets of its Classification system of Haematolymphoid neoplasias. Flow cytometry is a powerful, rapid and convenient technique for the immunophenotypic identification as well as monitoring of many hematopoietic neoplasms.
                        The technique analyzes the physical and chemical characteristics of particles in a fluid as it passes through at least one laser. Cell components are fluorescently labeled and then excited by the laser to emit light at varying wavelengths. It is routinely used in the diagnosis of health disorders, especially blood cancers.</p>
