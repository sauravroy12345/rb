                     <p>An electrocardiogram records the electrical signals in your heart. It's a common test used to detect heart problems and monitor the heart's status in many situations. Electrocardiograms  also called ECGs or EKGs â€” are often done in a doctor's office, a clinic or a hospital room. And they've become standard equipment in operating rooms and ambulances. An ECG is a noninvasive, painless test with quick results. During an ECG, sensors (electrodes) that can detect the electrical activity of your heart are attached to your chest and sometimes your limbs. These sensors are usually left on for just a few minutes.</p>

                      <p>The use of ultrasound radiations to generate images of the heart is known as Echo Cardiogram. The process is non-internal and hasslefree. The patient is asked to remove all heavy jewelries and clothing and lie down on the provided table. The doctor/technician applies the ultrasound gel on the area above the heart and the external probe is applied over the gel rich area. The patient is required to be still as the echo cardiogram is in process. The examination lasts not more than fifteen to twenty minutes.</p>

                        Patients should have light food at least 4 hours prior to the test. If the patient is undergoing any medication that should be told to doctor as it can change the result of the test. A relative should accompany him/her. Doctorâ€™s prescription and ECG is mandatory.

For male patients chest hair must be shaved up to navel. It is advised to have bath or shower before the procedure starts. All patients must bring their original voter id and previous diagnostic or operative reports & film. Usually, the number of hours that the patient has to wear the device is predetermined by the doctor. Admission is advised for 24 or more hours holter monitoring.</p>
